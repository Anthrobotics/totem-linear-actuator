# Totem Linear Actuator Hardware - Anthrobotics Adaptation
This subfolder contains the adapted / remixed versions of the Totem actuator from POINTBLANK. We required slightly different strokes for our leg design, and made a few changes to it, as well as to the mounting system for the actuator.
Despite being developed on older releases of the actuator, the overall performance and build process remain largely the same.
